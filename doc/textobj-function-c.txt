==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION				     *textobj-function-c-introduction*

*textobj-function-c* is a Vim additional filetype plugin to provide text
objects for functions in C language.  This is a support script for
|textobj-function|, so that you have to install it to enable the text objects.
Unless installing, this script does nothing.


Requirements:
- Vim 7.2 or later
- |textobj-function| 0.1.0 or later (vimscript#2619)

Latest version:
http://github.com/kana/config/commits/vim-textobj-function

==============================================================================
INTERFACE					*textobj-function-c-interface*

See |textobj-function| for the details.  Because this plugin just enhances the
power of textobj-function and does not provide any user interface.




==============================================================================
BUGS						*textobj-function-c-bugs*

- Assumption: C functions must be written in the following style:
>
	return-type
	function-name(arg1, arg2, ..., argN)
	{
		...
	}
<
  - return-type must be written in one line.
  - function-name must be followed by "(".
  - argument list may be written in one or more lines, but the last line must
    end with ")".

- If the cursor is between two functions, the next function will be selected.

- See |textobj-function-bugs| for further information.
